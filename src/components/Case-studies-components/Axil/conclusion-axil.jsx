                Axil was both a fun and challenging project for me. I enjoyed applying the skills Iâ€™ve gained over time working with Design Systems to build what I thought was the best starting point for a small to medium-sized design team.

                I believe Axil is a useful tool that will help teams build design systems quickly and effectively when implemented.
