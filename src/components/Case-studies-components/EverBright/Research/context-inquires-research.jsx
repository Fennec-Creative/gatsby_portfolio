              To work around our poor real-user access, I tapped my personal network of homeowners with solar panel systems and conducted a series of 6 interviews. 
              </p>
              <p className="mb-20">
              For each interview I asked my participants a series of 8 questions, and had them walk me through a typical session with their digital home-owner portal. 
              </p>
              <p>
              I consolidated the notes from these interviews and organized them by theme to identify patterns and action items.
