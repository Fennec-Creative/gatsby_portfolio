                Impromptu Interviews

                I went through several rounds of impromptu tests with solar energy homeowners in my personal network.

              Useberry User Test
              </h3>
              <p className="mb-20">
              I oversaw a series of unmoderated user studies via Useberry where users were asked to describe what they thought they saw and complete a series of tasks.

              The test had a very high success rate and gave me valuable feedback on how I could improve with my final iteration.
