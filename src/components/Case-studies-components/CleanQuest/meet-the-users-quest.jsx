              The number of users for this project was two - one of which was myself. This made getting unbiased data essentially impossible. I decided to try anyway.

              I kicked off this project with a user interview and contextual inquiry. My husband, being a wonderfully good sport, played along with both and I ended up getting a lot of useful insights.
